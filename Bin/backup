# Backup
# The backup script will:
#   * tar up the entire home directory
#   * put the .tar.gz into my external hard drive (NTFSboy)
#   * tar up NTFSboy's Essential folder, put it in Downloads/Backup

#e.g 10_25_2015
currentDate="date +%m_%d_%Y"

# Tars the home directory, making a
# /home/nate_{timestamp}.tar.gz package

    cd /home/
